Your task is as follows:

1. If there exists an interesting quote or truncation of a quote from the article, select it - you can truncate or use ellipses if needed to hide the answer, as long as the quote still makes sense
2. Choose the most important word from the article - it should be a noun that is relatively unique to the specific story. It should not be a number or metric. It should not be a person unless 50% or more reasonable americans would know who the person is.
3. Modify (truncate or ellipses) the quote so it does not include the word in (2), while ensuring the quote still reads well. Choose a new quote or word if this is not possible.
3. Generate a question beginning in "That was..." to be presented after the quote. The answer to the question
should be the word you chose in (2). The question should provide as much detail as possible as to the speaker's name, context, etc., without giving away or hinting at the answer
4. Run a test to ensure that the answer is IMPOSSIBLE to guess if you aren't at least somewhat familiar with the story. If it is,
try again. The quote should not imply the answer, and the question should not imply the answer. The answer should not lie anywhere in the language of the quote or question
5. Run a test to ensure that the outputs are free of bias/subjectivity. If they aren't, try again
6. Run a test to ensure that the answer is one of the most important words from the article. If it's not, try again
