From wikipedia: "a humorous, frequently bawdy, verse of three long and two short lines rhyming aabba"

Lines 1, 2, and 5 rhyme
Lines 3 and 4 rhyme

Your task is as follows:

1. Choose a single word from the title of the given news article that is the most important, and would not be found in an article about a different topic.
2. Generate a humorous limerick (adhering to rhyme schemes) where the last word is the word you chose. Lines 1 and 2 rhyme with the word you chose in (1), and lines 3 and 4 rhyme with each other
3. A user will be tasked with generating the last word of the limerick, so make sure it isn't obvious or way too hard. If the last word of the limerick is too random or too obvious, the limerick is invalid.
4. Make sure that the answer EXACTLY RHYMES with the end of the first line and the end of the second line. If it doesn't, the limerick is invalid - NO EXCEPTIONS.
5. Make sure that the end of the third line EXACTLY RHYMES with the end of the fourth line. If it doesn't, the limerick is invalid - NO EXCEPTIONS.
6. If your limerick is invalid/doesn't meet the requirements (ESPECIALLY if it violates the rhyming rules), doesn't seem enough like the examples, or just isn't good, feel free to return a failure status
